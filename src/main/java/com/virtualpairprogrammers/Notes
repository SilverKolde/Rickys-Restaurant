Model   - MenuDao and others. All the logic and stuff
View    - jsp files that are seen in the browser
Control - servlets. That's the glue, that's holding everything together.
          It commonly extracts any incoming parameters, calls the model and depending on the outcome (success or failure)
          will forward to the appropriate View. They are in control of the application flow - which page is shown to the user and when.
