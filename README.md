## A little backstory, how this project came to be
After 2nd semester in Tartu University, I realized that I know how to write code, but have no idea how the web works. So I took an Web Development Bootcamp course from Udemy by Colt Steele. Worked with Jquery, Node.js and MongoDB. Unfortunately I managed to lose the source code for that project, hence I have nothing to showcase. Having learned the very basics during June-July (took that long because I had to work during daytime to support my studies), I still had no idea how one of the biggest languages - Java - fits into web development. After some reasearch I decided to start with fundamentals and took on another Udemy course to learn about servlets and JSPs.
